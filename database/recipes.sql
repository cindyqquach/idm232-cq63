(38, 'Kimchi Pancakes', 'it makes me really happy when I find out someone tried out a recipe to share with family. Someone wrote on one of the comments that her son loves kimchi pancakes, and requested me to do a video. so I jumped on it because this is something so easy to make! \r\nwell, so easy if you have the korean pancake mixes- buchim mix and tempura mix in a 1:1 ratio, with just water.\r\nbut what if you didn’t? \r\nHere’s the recipe with measurements you can try without the Asian-supermarket specific mixes :) enjoy.\r\n', '5 Tbsp flour.\r\n1.5 Tbsp cornstarch.\r\n1/2 tsp baking powder.\r\n1/2 cup water.\r\nSalt , pepper.\r\n3 chopstick-fulls of kimchi , or to your liking.\r\nScallions, optional but delicious if added.\r\nShrimp, optional.\r\n', '1. Mix 5 Tbsp flour, 1.5 Tbsp cornstarch, 1/2 tsp baking powder with 1/2 cup water.\r\n2. Mix in the Kimchi, scallion, and shrimp. Season to taste.\r\n3. Heat your pan with copious amounts of oil.\r\n4. Place batter in the middle, then spread it thin to all corners with a spoon.\r\n5. Fill in any holes with small spoonfuls of batter.\r\n6. Wait 10 minutes on low heat. Check if you can move the pancake pretty easily on the pan before flipping. The top surface should be pretty much cooked. \r\n7. Flip and cook another 5-6 min on low heat. If the pan is dry, add some oil. This is important to making crispy and thin kimchi pancakes without burning it', '/dist/images/recipe38.png'),
(39, 'Baked Katsu Sando', 'es, this is an actual alternative to deep frying katsu and still have it taste GREAT. Not only that, it looks good, is healthier, and won’t stink up my studio apartment with the oil smell :) I discovered this on Just One Cookbook when I was in school, and I’ve made this so many times- for myself, friends, family, and boo’s (maybe just one :P). trust me on this- here’s the recipe!', '2 pieces of chicken thigh (or breast), seasoned to your liking \r\n1.5 cups breadcrumbs\r\n3 Tbsp olive oil\r\n1 egg\r\n1/4 cup flour\r\nmilk toast\r\nmayo', 'Toast the breadcrumbs in olive oil until golden brown on medium heat, constantly stirring. Don’t burn em!\r\nbread the chicken (flour, egg, toasted crumbs).\r\npop it in the oven on an open rack, bake 20 min at 350F.\r\n(check if it’s done by making a cut through the thickest part).\r\nspread mayo on your toast.\r\nput katsu in between, press with hand or plate. Cut off the crusts, and cut in half.\r\nenjoy :)\r\n\r\n', '/dist/images/recipe39.png'),

Once the onions are cooked, add butter, parmesan cheese (save half of it for later), parsley, and milk and mix until it bubbles thick and smooth. \r\n6. Add boiling water, about 1 cup\r\n7.
